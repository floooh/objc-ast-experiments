This is an experiment to create language bindings to macOS 
Objective-C APIs by parsing the output of 'clang -ast-dump=json'.

To dampen the expectations a bit: it's useful for replacing specific snippets
of Objective-C code, but it's probably too brittle as a general solution for
writing large macOS applications in 'random' programming languages. Reason
being that the output of 'clang -ast-dump' exposes tons of small type
definition details which need to be handled specifically by the output
parser. Supporting new system header declarations is mostly a trial-and-error
process where the parser balks at some of the more complex type definitions
in the macOS system headers, so adding new declarations to be 'exported' is a
trial-and-error process.

## How it works

Conversion happens in two steps: first a simplified 'intermediate representation'
of the detailed AST output is generated with the script ```gen_ir.py```. 

```gen_ir.py``` takes a JSON file as input which describes the declarations that
should be extracted from the system headers (C structs, enums and functions, 
ObjC interfaces, protocols and categories and their methods).

The output of ```gen_ir.py``` is another JSON file with a simplified descriptions
of the extracted declarations:

```
> python3 gen_ir.py hello.json hello_ir.json
```

Running ```gen_ir.py``` takes a little while (10..20 seconds) because it
needs to chew through a several hundred megabytes big JSON file (the output
of ```clang -ast-dump```), and there's also a couple of quadratic loops which
should be optimized.

The generated IR JSON file is then fed to a language-specific code-generation
script. For instance to generate a C header:

```
> python gen_c.py hello_ir.json test/macos.c test/macos.h
```

Additionally, to generate the Zig module:

```
> python gen_zig.py hello_ir.json test/macos.zig
```

## Building the examples

The ```test``` subdirectory contains example programs which implement a
Cocoa+Metal *Hello Triangle*. ```hello.m``` is the 'reference' ObjC 
implementation, ```hello.c``` is the C version which uses the generated
header ```hello.h```.

To build the tests, run:

```
# build the ObjC reference:
> ./build_objc.sh
# build the C test:
> ./build_c.sh
# build the Zig test:
> ./build_zig.sh
```

This results in the executables ```hello_objc```, ```hello_c``` and ```hello_zig```.
